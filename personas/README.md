# Scenarios
Anne
- It has been a long Monday and Ann just finished eating at home. After taking a break, Ann they don’t know what assignment to start on. They check all the assignments on Canvas and start to get overwhelmed by the amount of work. Anne starts writing down the assignments shown on canvas and her recreational activities to her physical calendar. The list is long and the space provided is narrow. It is inconvenient for her to bring it everywhere with her and by the time she finishes writing everything down, she could have done one of her assignment
