# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Methods:
* We did a competitive analysis for Schedule Builder.
* looked at 6 different apps, 
* listed advantages and disadvantages 
  * competitors are Google Calendar, Canva, Notion, Connecteam, Monday.com, and Goodnotes.        
  * Apps and websites are lacking:        
     * the ability to shift the Canvas calendar to their app.             
  * Many are free and if users want extra features then they have a subscription for it. 
             
Findings:
* Heuristic Evaluation was about 
  * Google Calendar is our biggest competitor.    
  * scored between 8-10 in 8 out of 9 categories.    
    * Scored 5 on ‘Flexibility and efficiency of use Aesthetic and minimalist design   
    * Did not have a minimalist design and had a messy feel when creating a new event or task.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**
**Informal Feedback** found areas for improvement by providing new features that could be added. 
* Switching views: Users gave positive feedback about the ability to switch between list, weekly, and monthly views.
* Deadline: Reminders for assignments before deadline and implementing a feature to prevent overbooking.
* Positive reinforcement: Helps encourage users to complete phases of an assignment by associating it with something to look forward to. 

**Cognitive Walkthrough** on early wireframes found missing elements and points of confusion.
* Missing Screens: missing screens include transitions, settings, account information, help, and add events/assignments.
* Confusion with certain screens and their elements: confusion with what things are included with “details” and where they will appear.
* Ambiguity with buttons and features: confusion with what certain buttons will do or where they lead, and with how certain features will work or appear.
* Missing feedback: Users are uncertain if their information is saved because of a lack of feedback.

**Wireframes** based on findings, emphasize a modern design with a focus on easy navigation. Added missing screens, elements, and examples of features working as intended. Implemented feedback to show that progress and information is being saved.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

**User Testing** found new things we can improve in our app.
* Users want a way to view assignments based on completion.
* Users want a larger clicking area when interacting with assignments.
* users wished the edit button for assignments was larger and easier to find.
* Users wished the 'add assignment' button was larger.
* Users wished it was easier to edit assignments and events.
* Uses wanted to be able to make changes to the descriptions of assignments.
* All users mentioned a lack of feedback from the prototype.
* Users mentioned text being too small.
* Users mentioned a lack of an edit button on the List View.

**What that means**
* We need to change the size of icons and text to make our app more readable.
* We need to change the area in which users can click to make the app more easily navigable.
* We need to change the amount and type of feedback to let users know that an action has happened.
* We need to add features that allow users to edit assignments at a lower level and we need to make that easier.
