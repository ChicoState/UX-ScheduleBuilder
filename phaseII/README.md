# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The general problem that is being addressed is the look of the app, as well as the usability. The formatting of the application needs to be learnable, and the functionality of the application needs to be efficient. We are concentrating on the feel of the app to provide an enjoyable experience for the users. With our preexisting wireframes and sketches, we got user feedback on how to best improve our UX design.


## Methods

**Informal Feedback**
* Informal feedback was used to discover new insights about the app. We asked users questions 
about the look and feel of our app. The questions asked were: 
    
    1) Which of these would you want to be the default main screen? 
    2) What information would you like to be shown about each assignment or task in an app like this? 
    
This was conducted to get opinions on how our app should look and what information users want presented. These questions were asked to college students, the main audience we are targeting. 


**Wireframe and cognitive walkthrough**
* We created wireframes from our sketches and gave them to a few college students to let them perform a cognitive walkthrough analysis. They tried to complete tasks based on the personas we created previously. At each step, they were asked these set of questions:
    
    1) Will the user know what to do at this step?
    2) If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?
       
The purpose of the walkthrough was to ensure that our app was usable and there was a screen for each step.


## Findings

From informal feedback, we found that
* Users like the ability to switch between different ‘views’.
* Users want the ability to see all deadlines and need a feature to prevent overbooking for a specific date.
* Users like positive reinforcement as encouragement to finish a task
  
From the cognitive walkthrough, we found that,
* Users pointed out missing screens and features.
* Users pointed out ambiguity with elements.
* Users pointed out unlabeled or ambiguously labeled buttons.
* Users pointed out a lack of feedback for doing actions. 


## Conclusions

Our findings indicate that we must include additional elements in our wireframe, and certain features lack clarity. We added more ‘screens’ for our wireframe to satisfy these findings and included example assignments in the wireframe. We also clarified what buttons do and what is currently being shown to decrease ambiguity. Implementing these additional elements allowed for clarity and a smoother user experience. 


## Caveats

Feedback from both methods is informal and from a narrow range of people. making it less accurate. In our informal feedback, there was a limitation in the questions we could ask. Subjects performing the cognitive walkthrough may or may not have had experience performing cognitive walkthroughs.
