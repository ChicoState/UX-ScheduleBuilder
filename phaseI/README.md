# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
Planning out when to do assignments can be hard for some students for multiple reasons, it takes a lot of time, or they are distracted, or they don’t have the motivation to do so. Also some students don’t know how to plan out their assignments and end up trying to do all of them a day before they are due.

## Methods
We used Heuristic Evaluation, and competitive analysis on other calendar apps that are commonly used by students or organizations. With heuristic evaluation we looked at what features competing calendar apps have that make them easy to use or hard to use. During competitive analysis we looked at what calendar apps are used most commonly and why they are used. We looked at the pros and cons of using each calendar by looking at reviews and problems people had with each. 


## Findings
Heuristic evaluation revealed that for some calendars it is hard to create shared calendars with other users, it also revealed that integrating different calendars is easy with most calendar apps.
Competitive analysis revealed that most of the competing calendar apps don’t have a feature to recommend times to complete tasks before they are due. It also revealed that integrations for school related applications are lacking, and that the details shown on the calendar are not what is desired for some students.

## Conclusions

We found that Google Calendar was one of the best calendar apps on the market. It has many features that people enjoy such as transferring the calendar from Canvas, being easily shareable, and being easy for beginners to use. But people are still not happy with it because it is aesthetically displeasing and can be messy. People enjoy websites like Notion, Canva, and Goodnotes for their customizability options, but these apps don’t have the best basic calendar features, like shareability or transferring classes from Canvas. 

These findings will shape our future work because we know we need to implement a sleek look so new users aren’t overwhelmed. Users will be able to transfer classes from Canvas and our website to generate a timeline for when they should start their assignments. In addition, the users will be able to customize if they please.


## Caveats

Our biggest caveat was the lack of user data, this was based on the opinion of three people. There is a lack of UX experience from the people involved.
