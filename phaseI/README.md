# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
Planning out when to do assignments can be hard for some students for multiple reasons, it takes a lot of time, or they are distracted, or they don’t have the motivation to do so. Also some students don’t know how to plan out their assignments and end up trying to do all of them a day before they are due.

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods
We used Heuristic Evaluation, and competitive analysis on other calendar apps that are commonly used by students or organizations. With heuristic evaluation we looked at what features competing calendar apps have that make them easy to use or hard to use. During competitive analysis we looked at what calendar apps are used most commonly and why they are used. We looked at the pros and cons of using each calendar by looking at reviews and problems people had with each. 

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings
Heuristic evaluation revealed that for some calendars it is hard to create shared calendars with other users, it also revealed that integrating different calendars is easy with most calendar apps.
Competitive analysis revealed that most of the competing calendar apps don’t have a feature to recommend times to complete tasks before they are due. It also revealed that integrations for school related applications are lacking, and that the details shown on the calendar are not what is desired for some students. 


!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
