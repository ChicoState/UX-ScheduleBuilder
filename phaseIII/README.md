# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

The problem addressed is that we don’t know if our design works with users' mental images. We did user testing on people who have not used the app before to see if our UI fits the mental image of the users. We also used the test to receive feedback on any design choices we made and how users would use the different functionalities the app provided. All the testing was done with the end goal or applying what we learned to our UI design. 

## Methods

**Informal Feedback**

The informal feedback was used to discover new insights and new needs about the website. We asked a class of students about how we could improve our application further. The questions we asked were:
* For the assignment list do you like the breakdown or would you do it another way?
* If we created a leaderboard would you want it reset daily, weekly, monthly, etc?
* If you could change one thing about the UI what would it be?
* This was conducted to get opinions of how to further improve the website. The people that were answering the questions are college students, which is our target audience. 

Usability Test
The usability testing was conducted with prototypes and college students. We created prototypes based on our wireframes and gave them to 6 college students to do a usability test. They completed 3 tasks that our team created to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of our application. Our tasks were:
* Task 1: Once you have signed in, your goal is to transfer your calendar from Canvas to our app. When you have connected your goal is to view the assignment description.
* Task 2: How would you go about adding a task? Now edit that task to occur weekly.
* Task 3: How would you go about editing an assignment to better fit your schedule?

Task 1 was to see the effectiveness of connecting to Canvas because it is not a method many people may be aware of, task 2 was to see user satisfaction of adding a task, and task 3 was to see user satisfaction of editing an event. We kept track of whether they were able to complete each task. After each task they were asked to rate the difficulty on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is “Very Difficult” and 5 is “Very Easy”, and why. After the tasks were completed, we asked the participant 3 questions about what they liked and disliked about the application. The questions were:
* What were some frustrations you had with the app?
* What did you like about the app?
* Do you see yourself using this app in the future?

## Findings

Based on the informal feedback we received from SE, users have expressed to change several elements to the prototype's design and functionality. Users would like a table that features three categories - Not Started, In Progress, and Completed- on the Listview Page. This additional feature is to provide another way to break down assignments. Users want the website to prompt them to update events on the day they are scheduled to work on them while facilitating the display of completion status. Another feature is adding leaderboards based on events. This would allow users to compete with friends by adding them to their network. Users wanted more color, a sharper design, and an aesthetically pleasing calendar.
From the Informal Feedback we found
* Users would like a table with three categories, not started, in progress, and completed on the home page after the “List View” as another way to break down assignments.
* Users want the website to prompt users to update events if they are supposed to work on it that day to show completion status.
* Users want leaderboards according to events and be able to add friends to so you are competing with your friends on events.
* Users want more colors, sharper design, and a nicer-looking calendar



From the Usability Testing we found 
All users possess some form of experience with a calendar/planner or calendar applications. A majority expressed interest in using this web app in the future. All users completed all three assigned tasks. 
* All users have some form of experience with a calendar app or website
* Many are open to use this app in the future
* All users completed all 3 tasks.

In Task 1, Participant feedback revealed a varied perception of difficulty. One-sixth of the participants assigned a difficulty rating of 5, three-sixths rating of 4, and two-sixths for a rating of 3. Users want a larger clicking area when interacting with assignments. Some did not like the connection process to Canvas. Additionally, some participants reported confusion regarding certain features within the prototype.
Task 1 
* 1/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 5
* 3/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 4
* 2/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 3
* Users want a bigger clicking area when viewing assignment
* Users didn’t like how you connect to Canvas
* Users were confused on some features on the prototype

In Task 2, Three-sixths assigned a difficulty rating of 5, one-sixth a rating of 4,  one-sixth a rating of 3, and the remaining participant assigned a difficulty rating of 2. Users express a need for an edit button when making changes to an event they had created. Participants emphasized the desire for increased visibility of the "plus" symbol. Additionally, users expressed a need for more comprehensive feedback and enhanced clarity from the prototype. 
Task 2 
* 3/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 5 
* 1/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 4
* 1/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 3
* 1/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 2
* Users pointed out there was no edit button if they wished to make changes on an event they created.
* Users wished the “+” symbol was more noticeable
* Users needed more feedback and clarity from the prototype

 ![task2](https://github.com/ChicoState/UX-ScheduleBuilder/assets/117888435/c2b5cf54-796d-4922-b9aa-b3e54074cb60)


In Task 3, three-sixths assigned a difficulty rating of 5, one-sixth a rating of 4, and two-sixths a rating of 3. Users want an adjustment to the existing edit button, along with the capability to edit event descriptions. Users generally found the task to be straightforward, expressing ease in navigating the interface and confidently locating the relevant information. 
Task 3
* 3/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 5
* 1/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 4
* 2/6 participants gave a difficult rating of 3
* Users requested an alteration of the exciting edit button and they wanted the ability to edit the description as well. 
* Users found the task easy and knew where to look. 

![task3](https://github.com/ChicoState/UX-ScheduleBuilder/assets/117888435/48bf968a-7452-4a02-9f84-a18628397730)


Users liked the ability to view an overview of created events. The connection/integration* with Canvas had positive feedback. Users like the sidebar, acknowledging its utility and ease of navigation. The overall layout of the application also received favorable comments. 
Users liked:
* being able to see an overview of created events
* Connecting to Canvas
* The sidebar
* Layout

Users experienced frustration with various aspects. A frustration was not knowing where to click. The inability to edit event descriptions. Text size being small compared to the rest of the site. There was dissatisfaction with the inability to change or save certain information. The absence of an edit button. 
Users were frustrated by: 
* Not knowing where to click
* Not being able to edit the description
* Text being too small compared to the rest of the site
* Not being able to change/save
* Not being able to edit from list view


## Conclusions

Our findings indicate that we must include or alter certain elements in our prototype and certain features lack clarity. We added a color accent to our prototype, changed the line weights, and font for a neater look. Implementing these additional elements allowed for clarity and direction for a smoother user experience. We added additional screens to meet user needs, such as a leadership board and friends lists, which allows you to compete with your friends.

## Caveats

The feedback from both methods was from a narrow range of people, we were limited to the people from class. The usability test also did not explore all parts of the prototypes, such as the friends list and leaderboard. Participants taking part in the usability testing may ot may not have had experience with testing beforehand.
